  <h3>Privacy Policy (Summary)</h3>

  <p>Since we allow you to login via Facebook, we have to have a privacy policy per facebook's requirements.</p>

  <p>It boils down to: We will store your name, email, username, and facebook avatar link.  Your name and avatar link will be used when displaying notes you have created on the site.  Your email will not be shared, and is only kept so you can initiate password resets and login without facebook if you like.</p>

  <h3>Privacy Policy (Verbose)</h3>

  <p>We use technologies like cookies (small files stored on your browser), to identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience. Our systems also log information like your browser, operating system and IP address.</p>

  <p>We also may collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. If authorized by you, we may also access profile and other information from services like Facebook.</p>

  <p>Our systems may associate this personal information with your activities in the course of providing service to you (such as pages you view or things you click on or search for).</p>

  <p>We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.</p>

  <p>We do not collect, use or share your precise geographic location.</p>

  <p>You can sign into your account to see any personally identifiable information we have stored, such as your name, email, address or phone number.</p>

  <p>We may keep data indefinitely.</p>

  <p>We generally do not share personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with other companies.</p>

  <p>We do not allow advertising companies to collect data through our service for ad targeting.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, please contact one of the site administrators.</p>

  <p>In the unlikely event that a warrant is issued by an agent of the US government requesting such, we may make identifiable and anonmoys information available to said agent.  If this occurs we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.</p>
